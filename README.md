This course has been designed by two professional Data Scientists to share their knowledge and help one learn complex theory, algorithms, and coding libraries in a simple way.

This is a step-by-step into the World of Machine Learning. 

This course is fun and exciting, but at the same time, we dive deep into Machine Learning. It is structured the following way:

## Summary

| Sr. No | Section                                                                     | Sub-section                                                                    |

| 4.     | Clustering        | K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering        |
| 5.     | Association Rule Learning | Apriori, Eclat |
| 6.     | Reinforcement Learning | Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling |
| 7.     | Natural Language Processing                   | Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP                   |
| 8.     | Deep Learning         | Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks         |
| 9.     | Dimensionality Reduction             | PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA             |
| 10.     | Model Selection & Boosting           | k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost           |


Moreover, the course is packed with practical exercises that are based on real-life examples. So not only did I learn the theory, but I also got some hands-on practice building my own models.
