# Repository for the course [Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)
## Created by [Kirill Eremenko](https://www.udemy.com/user/kirilleremenko/) and [Hadelin de Ponteves](https://www.udemy.com/user/hadelin-de-ponteves/)

This course has been designed by two professional Data Scientists to share their knowledge and help one learn complex theory, algorithms, and coding libraries in a simple way.

This is a step-by-step into the World of Machine Learning. With every tutorial, one will be able to develop new skills and improve their understanding of this challenging yet lucrative sub-field of Data Science.

This course is fun and exciting, but at the same time, we dive deep into Machine Learning. It is structured the following way:

## Summary

| 8.     | Deep Learning         | Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks         |
| 9.     | Dimensionality Reduction             | PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA             |
| 10.     | Model Selection & Boosting           | k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost           |


Moreover, the course is packed with practical exercises that are based on real-life examples. So not only will one learn the theory, but you will also get some hands-on practice building your own models.
