And putting our values into a double pair of square brackets makes the input exactly a 2D array.\n","\n","**Important note 2:** Notice also that the \"France\" country was not input as a string in the last column but as \"1, 0, 0\" in the first three columns. That's because of course the predict method expects the one-hot-encoded values of the state, and as we see in the first row of the matrix of features X, \"France\" was encoded as \"1, 0, 0\". And be careful to include these values in the first three columns, because the dummy variables are always created in the first columns."],"metadata":{"id":"a8GEnftGbbV8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"u7yx47jPZt11"},"source":["### Predicting the Test set results"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["y_pred = ann.predict(X_test)\n","y_pred = (y_pred > 0.5)\n","print(np.concatenate((y_pred.reshape(len(y_pred),1), y_test.reshape(len(y_test),1)),1))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"G3V31uGCbThL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1658535845238,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":510,"user":{"displayName":"Aatam Gajjar","userId":"14613474980181415041"}},"outputId":"b931ad67-09ac-409e-cb99-87ed457449b3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[[0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," ...\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]\n"," [0 0]]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o0oyfLWoaEGw"},"source":["### Making the Confusion Matrix"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score\n","print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))\n","print(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AyVyWThTcMJv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1658535913407,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":128,"user":{"displayName":"Aatam Gajjar","userId":"14613474980181415041"}},"outputId":"f3f20750-339f-472f-dc44-b25f422113f0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[[1537   48]\n"," [ 222  193]]\n","0.865\n"]}]}]}
